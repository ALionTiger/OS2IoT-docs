# Governance

As OS2iot belongs to [OS2's portfolio](https://os2.eu/produkter) of open source IT solutions made for and by the Danish public institutions, 
it is the members of the [OS2 community](https://os2.eu/node/332) (with a steering committee in front, supported by a project manager and a coordination group) who governs the code and decide the direction of OS2iot.


[We welcome contributions - such as suggestions for changes, bug reporting, or general feedback - from anyone](https://github.com/OS2iot/OS2IoT-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

  
We will try to respond promptly to all pull requests. 
The pull request is an opportunity to work together to improve OS2iot. We may not accept all changes, but we will explain our logic.

Our overall aim with the governance of OS2iot, is to prevent lots of different master versions of the code. 

You are more than welcome to contact the OS2 secretary at "os2@os2.eu" if you have any questions regarding the governance of OS2iot. 

Happy sensing!
